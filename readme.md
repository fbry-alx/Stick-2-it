# Project 1 - Stick-2-It - Fabry & Zach

Our idea is a habit tracker app called Stick-2-It. Each user will be able to log in, and set which habits they want to work on. Each habit will have a name and a frequency, whether the user want to work on it once, twice, three times per week, etc. The user will then be able to log each activity/task they did for each habit they are tracking. The activity/task will have a name, duration, and any notes the user wants to add about their activity.

## Visual Style

We want a minimalist/modern style to our page, with rounded edges, soft limited colors, and sans serif fonts. Below are some visual inspirations for the various parts of our app. 

#### Home Page

![](./images/insp4.png)[Grayscale Theme for Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/previews/grayscale/)

A simple home page with a large image taking up most/all of the screen. Some nav buttons along the top and a central button prompting the user to login/sign up. The purpose of this page is to look clean and inspiring. 

#### User Profile

### Figma Page Mock ups

Fabry put some time into making some mock ups in Figma that refelect what we are looking to do, combining our wireframes and visual inspiration.
