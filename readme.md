# Project 1 - Stick-2-It - Fabry & Zach

Our idea is a habit tracker app called Stick-2-It. Each user will be able to log in, and set which habits they want to work on. Each habit will have a name and a frequency, whether the user want to work on it once, twice, three times per week, etc. The user will then be able to log each activity/task they did for each habit they are tracking. The activity/task will have a name, duration, and any notes the user wants to add about their activity.

## User Stories

User will arrive at our landing page, and be able to login to their Stick-2-It account. Once they login they will be able to add any number of habits they want to track to their account, the user can also edit their profile information. 

Once they have added their habits, they can then log each activity they've done and create a log of each activity within each habit. The user can add, modify, and delete any habit. If the user deletes a habit, that will also delete the log of activities the user did for that habit. 

Then the app will take that data and show stats on the users profile page with the average duration, number of times each week etc. 

The user can log out at any time, in which case the only part of the website they will be able to access is the landing page. 

## Visual Style

We want a minimalist/modern style to our page, with rounded edges, soft limited colors, and sans serif fonts. Below are some visual inspirations for the various parts of our app. 

#### Home Page

A simple home page with a large image taking up most/all of the screen. Some nav buttons along the top and a central button prompting the user to login/sign up. The purpose of this page is to look clean and inspiring. 

#### User Profile

### Figma Page Mock ups

Fabry put some time into making some mock ups in Figma that refelect what we are looking to do, combining our wireframes and visual inspiration.
